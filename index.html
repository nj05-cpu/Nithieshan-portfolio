    <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe AI</h3>
    <p>
A command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Python with an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm. The AI evaluates future game states to select optimal moves, demonstrating recursion, game-tree search, and algorithmic decision-making with clean turn-based logic.

    <h3>Flashcard Web App</h3>
    <p>
A full-stack Flask web application that allows users to create, manage, and review digital flashcards stored using JSON-based persistence. The application supports adding, editing, deleting, and reviewing flashcards through a clean and intuitive interface rendered with Jinja2 templates.

The project demonstrates backend web development skills including routing, form handling, template rendering, and server-side logic, while maintaining a lightweight and modular architecture. Emphasis was placed on usability, clear data organization, and extensibility, making the application suitable as an educational productivity tool and a foundation for future enhancements such as user authentication or spaced repetition.    </p>

    <h3>OCR Course Analyzer</h3>
    <p>
An OCR processing pipeline built using Python, PyMuPDF, and Tesseract OCR to extract structured information from unstructured PDF course outline documents. The system converts PDFs into images, performs text extraction, and identifies key academic data such as course codes, evaluation breakdowns, and grading components.

The pipeline is designed as a multi-stage workflow that handles diverse document formats, validates extracted text accuracy, and detects errors caused by irregular layouts or low-quality scans. Extracted results are returned in structured JSON format, enabling downstream analysis and automation. This project demonstrates applied computer vision concepts, data validation, and building robust pipelines for real-world document processing.    </p>

    <h3>Finite State Machine Simulator</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a finite state machine simulator in C that processes user input, performs state transitions, detects invalid or garbage states, and supports dynamic state deletion and garbage collection. The program allows configuration printing and interactive testing of state behavior. This project demonstrates strong understanding of low-level programming, memory management, data structures, and implementing abstract computational models in C.

    <h3>Restaurant Ordering & Reservation DBMS</h3>
    <p>
      Designed and implemented a full-stack restaurant database system to manage
      customers, reservations, seating, menus, bills, and payments using Oracle SQL.
      The project involved defining functional dependencies, normalizing schemas to
      3NF/BCNF, and writing complex SQL queries and scripts for data integrity.
      A Java Swing based interface was used to interact with the database,
      showcasing skills in database design, normalization, SQL optimization, and
      backend integration.
